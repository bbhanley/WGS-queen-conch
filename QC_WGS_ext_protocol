###Queen conch extraction protocol
##Using the Omega E.Z.N.A. mollusc extraction kit D3373-02

##Digestion
#Prep:
Molecular water and n 2ml tubes for washing samples
n disposable razor blades
2n tweezers - two new tweezers for each sample
n 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, labeled
preheat thermomixer to 56C

#Steps:
1. Add 1ml molecular water into a 2ml tube for each sample

2. Cut two small 0.5 x 0.5 cm cubes of tissue from the original sample and place them in the 2mL microcentrifuge tube containing the molecular water. Each cube should be around 15 mg of tissue.

3. Submerge samples for 5 mins to remove any salt, then move to a clean 1.5 labeled microcentrifuge tube

4. Once all the samples have been soaked and are in new tubes, add 350 uL of ML1 Buffer AND 25 uL Proteinase K Solution. Vortex to mix

5. Incubate for overnight at 56C and 600 rpm




##Extraction
#Prep:
- Take note of any reagents that need ethanol or isopropanol added before use
- Set thermomixer to 70C
- Set up fume hood by placing down some paper towels and bringing in an extra rack for the samples, tips and a pipette, a waste bucket for used tips, a 50ml tube for aliquoting the chloroform isoamyl alcohol, and a rack to hold the aliquot
- The RNase A is stored in the 4C fridge
- Make new 3M NaOH if needed

#Steps:
1. In the fume hood, add 350ul chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to each sample. Wear safety glasses and long sleeves! Make a new aliquot for each extraction, and try to only aliquot the amount you need, not extra. If there is a small amount you didn’t use, dispose of it in the properly labeled hazardous waste container. After the chloroform is added, leave these things inside the fume hood for at least 2 hours to let any excess chloroform evaporate:
- Used tips
- Old sample rack
- Chloroform aliquot (leave this open) and it’s rack
- Hazardous waste container (closed)

2. Vortex to mix thoroughly – the liquid should turn a milky white

3. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 2 minutes. The sample should separate into 3 distinct layers.

4. Transfer the upper aqueous phase into a clean 1.5ml tube. Avoid the milky interface containing contaminants and inhibitors. Carefully record how much of the liquid you are able to aspirate from each sample – try to get as much as you can
If the upper aqueous phase is too small:
  a. Add 450ul ML1 buffer, vortex, and centrifuge at 10,000g for 2 minutes
- When you empty the remainder of what’s in the tubes after you get the aqueous phase you need, go in the fume hood and empty them into the properly labeled hazardous waste container

5. Add one volume BL Buffer and 10ul RNase A to each sample. Vortex at max speed for 15 seconds
- Ex. if you recovered 300ul upper aqueous phase from sample 1, you’ll add 300ul of BL buffer

6. Incubate at 70C for 10 minutes, then let cool to room temp (about 5 minutes). Put elution buffer on thermomixer to warm to 70C

7. Add one volume of fresh 100% ethanol. Vortex at max speed for 15 seconds.
- Ex. if you recovered 300ul upper aqueous phase from sample 1, you’ll add 300ul of 100% EtOH

8. Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a 2ml collection tube
  8.2 Optional column equilibration steps (this should always be done as long as we have 3M NaOH)
    a. Add 100ul 3M NaOH to the HiBind column
    b. Centrifuge at max speed for 60 seconds
    c. Discard filtrate and reuse collection tube

9. Transfer 600ul of sample from step 9, including any precipitate that may have formed, into the HiBind column
-If you have two digestions for one sample (ie. sample 1 and sample 1B), combine all of the supernatants from both digestions into one column

10. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 minute

11. Discard filtrate and reuse the collection tube.

12. Repeat steps 9 - 11 until all of the sample has been passed through the HiBind column

13. Discard filtrate and collection tube

14. Insert the HiBind column into a new 2ml collection tube

15. Add 500ul HBC buffer
- Note that HBC buffer must be diluted with 100% isopropanol before use according to the volume on the bottle. Buffer should be diluted when a new bottle is opened, before aliquoting. This should be indicated on the bottle.

16. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 30 seconds

17. Discard filtrate and reuse collection tube

18. Add 700ul DNA Wash Buffer
- Note that DNA Wash Buffer must be diluted with 100% ethanol before use according to the volume on the bottle. Buffer should be diluted when a new bottle is opened, before aliquoting 

19. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 minute

20. Discard filtrate and reuse collection tube

21. Repeat steps 17 - 19 for a second DNA Wash Buffer wash step

22. Centrifuge empty HiBind column at max speed for 2 minutes to dry the membrane
- Note that it is critical to remove any trace of ethanol from the column as it will interfere with downstream applications

23. Transfer the HiBind column to a new, clearly labeled 1.5ml tube

24. Add 40ul warmed Elution Buffer directly to the column filter

25. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes

26. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 minute

27. In the same tube, add 30ul warmed Elution Buffer directly to the column filter

28. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes

29. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 minute

If quantifying immediately, follow protocol for Qubit. If not quantifying immediately, store in the Prada -20C freezer in the appropriately labelled box
