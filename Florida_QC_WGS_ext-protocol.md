**Queen conch extraction protocol FLORIDA**

Using the Omega E.Z.N.A. mollusc extraction kit

Digestion

**Prep:**

* n 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes, labeled  
* preheat thermomixer to 56C

**Steps: \*\*This should be done around 10 am the day before the extraction is to be done so that the samples can sit for 24 hours\*\***

1. Place ALL of the sample into a clean 2mL tube. If there are two pieces, only take one

   

2. Add **500**uL of ML1 Buffer AND **50**uL Proteinase K Solution to the tubes 

   

3. Vortex to mix thoroughly

4. Incubate overnight at 56C and 600 rpm

Extraction

**Prep:**

* Take note of any reagents that need **ethanol** or **isopropanol** added before use  
* Set thermomixer to **70C**  
* Set up fume hood by placing down some paper towels and bringing in an extra rack for the samples, tips and a pipette, a waste bucket for used tips, a 50ml tube for aliquoting the chloroform isoamyl alcohol, and a rack to hold the aliquot  
* The **RNase A** is stored in the 4C fridge  
* Make new 3M NaOH if needed

**Steps:**

1. **In the fume hood**, add **550ul** chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to each sample. Wear safety glasses and long sleeves\! Make a new aliquot for each extraction, and try to only aliquot the amount you need, not extra. If there is a small amount you didn’t use, dispose of it in the **properly labeled hazardous waste container**. After the chloroform is added, leave these things inside the fume hood for **at least 2 hours** to let any excess chloroform evaporate:  
   1. Used tips  
   2. Old sample rack  
   3. Chloroform aliquot (leave this open) and its rack  
   4. Hazardous waste container (closed)

   

   

2. Vortex to mix thoroughly – the liquid should turn a milky white  
     
     
3. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 2 minutes  
     
     
4. Transfer the **upper aqueous phase** into a clean 1.5ml tube. **Avoid the milky interface** containing contaminants and inhibitors. Carefully record how much of the liquid you are able to aspirate from each sample – try to get as much as you can   
   1. If the upper aqueous phase is too small: Add 450ul ML1 buffer, vortex, and centrifuge at 10,000g for 2 minutes. 

   2.  **If the upper aqueous phase has a jelly-like viscosity:** 

   i. Transfer as much of the viscous liquid as you can into a spare 1.5mL tube

   

   ii. In the fume hood, add 350ul chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to the tube

   

   iii. Vortex the tube and centrifuge at 10,000g for 2 minutes

   

   iv. Transfer the **aqueous phase** into a clean 1.5ml tube– this should be labeled as “FLXX-B,”. **AVOID** any bubble (if present) when transferring the liquid

   

   v. **Proceed with the protocol for the** **original sample** starting from step **4a** (if extra ML 1 buffer is needed). Change the label of this original sample to “FLXX-A”. **There will now be TWO SEPARATE EXTRACTIONS for this sample\!\!**

   

   

   3. When you **empty the remainder** of what’s in the tubes after you get the aqueous phase you need, **go in the fume hood** and empty them into the **properly labeled hazardous waste container**

   

5. Add **one volume** BL Buffer and **10ul** RNase A to each sample. **Vortex at max speed** for 15 seconds  
   1. Ex. if you recovered 300ul upper aqueous phase from sample 1, you’ll add 300ul of BL buffer

   

6. Incubate at 70C for 10 minutes, then let cool to room temp (about 5 minutes). **Put elution buffer on thermomixer to warm to 70C**  
   

7. Add **one volume** of **fresh** 100% ethanol. Vortex at max speed for 15 seconds.  
   1. Ex. if you recovered 300ul upper aqueous phase from sample 1, you’ll add 300ul of 100% EtOH

   

8. Insert a HiBind DNA Mini Column into a 2ml collection tube  
   1. Optional column equilibration steps **(this should always be done as long as we have 3M NaOH)**  
      1. Add **100ul** 3M NaOH to the HiBind column  
      2. Centrifuge at max speed for 60 seconds  
      3. Discard filtrate and reuse collection tube

   

9. Transfer **600ul** of sample from step 9, **including any precipitate** that may have formed, into the HiBind column  
   

10. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 minute  
    

11. Discard filtrate and reuse the collection tube.  
    

12. **Repeat steps 9 \- 11** until all of the sample has been passed through the HiBind column  
    

13. Discard filtrate and collection tube  
    

14. Insert the HiBind column into a **new** 2ml collection tube  
    

15. Add **500ul** HBC buffer  
    1. Note that HBC buffer must be diluted with **100% isopropanol** before use according to the volume on the bottle. Buffer should be diluted when a new bottle is opened, before aliquoting 

    

16. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 30 seconds  
    

17. Discard filtrate and reuse collection tube  
    

18. Add **700ul** DNA Wash Buffer  
    1. Note that DNA Wash Buffer must be diluted with **100% ethanol** before use according to the volume on the bottle. Buffer should be diluted when a new bottle is opened, before aliquoting 

    

19. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 minute  
    

20. Discard filtrate and reuse collection tube  
    

21. **Repeat steps 17 \- 20 for a second DNA Wash Buffer wash step**  
    

22. Centrifuge **empty** HiBind column at max speed for 2 minutes to dry the membrane  
    1. Note that it is critical to remove any trace of ethanol from the column as it will interfere with downstream applications

    

23. Transfer the HiBind column to a new, clearly labeled 1.5ml tube  
    

24. Add **40ul** **warmed** Elution Buffer directly to the column filter  
    

25. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes  
    

26. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 minute  
    

27. **In the same tube**, add **30ul** **warmed** Elution Buffer directly to the column filter  
    

28. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes  
    

29. Centrifuge at 10,000g for 1 minute  
    

30. If quantifying immediately, follow protocol for Qubit. If not quantifying immediately, store in the Prada \-20C freezer in the appropriately labelled box
